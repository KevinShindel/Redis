  "description": "In this pulse-quickening novel, Alfred Bester imagines a future in which people \"jaunte\" a thousand miles with a single thought, where the rich barricade themselves in labyrinths and protect themselves with radioactive hitmenâ€”and where an inarticulate outcast is the most valuable and dangerous man alive. The Stars My Destination is a classic of technological prophecy and timeless narrative enchantment by an acknowledged master of science fiction.",
