In this town, people are told who to marry, where to live, where to work. Their children are taught that David Pilcher, the townâ€™s creator, is god. No one is allowed to leave; even asking questions can get you killed.But Ethan has discovered the astonishing secret of what lies beyond the electrified fence that surrounds Wayward Pines and protects it from the terrifying world beyond.
