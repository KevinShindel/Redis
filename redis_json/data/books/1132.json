There she meets Briar, a former thief who has a way with plants; Daja, an outcast gifted at metalcraft; and Tris, whose connection with the weather unsettles everyone, including herself.

Can Sandry weave together four kinds of magical power and save herself, her friends, and the one place where they've ever been accepted?",
