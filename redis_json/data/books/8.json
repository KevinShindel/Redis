Now, many years later, those dark days are fading into memory, and the world is at peace. But in the shadows a new threat is growing, a danger that can only be faced by a new kind of hero—a new kind of Ultraman…Who is Hokuto, really, and why has he shown up in the middle of a battle wearing an unsanctioned and unidentified Ultraman suit? His appearance is just another mystery on Shinjiro’s list of unanswered questions. The machinations of shadowy enemies are emerging, and Shinjiro finds himself even more shocked as events unfold.",
