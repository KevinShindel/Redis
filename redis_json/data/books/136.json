  "description": "Never afraid of risks, award-winning author John Varley took readers and critics by storm with his previous novel, Red Thunder. Now, Varley takes another leap into the great unknown with Mammoth...In a barren province of Canada, a mammoth hunter has made the discovery of a lifetime: an intact frozen woolly mammoth. But what he finds during the painstaking process of excavating the huge creature boggles the mind. Huddled next to the mammoth is the mummified body of a Stone Age man around 12,000 years old. And he is wearing a wristwatch.",
