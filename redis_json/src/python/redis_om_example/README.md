# RU204 Redis OM Python Example

The following example demonstrates data modeling with RedisJSON and the [Redis OM Python](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-python) client.

## Prerequisites

* You'll need [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher installed.
* You will need an instance of Redis Stack.  See the [setup instructions](/README.md) in the README at the root of this repo.
* If you are running your Redis Stack instance in the cloud or somewhere that isn't localhost:6379, you'll need to set the `REDIS_OM_URL` environment variable to point at your instance before running the code.  If you need help with the format for this, check out the [Redis URI scheme specification](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/redis).

## Setup

First, create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

Install Redis OM Python and any other dependencies before running the code:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that your Redis Stack instance is running, and that you have set the `REDIS_OM_URL` environment variable if necessary.  Example:

```bash
export REDIS_OM_URL=redis://user:password@host:port
```

## Run the Code

```bash
python json_om_example.py
```

## View the Code

The code is contained in [`json_om_example.py`](./json_om_example.py).
