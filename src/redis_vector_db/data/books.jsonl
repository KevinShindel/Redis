Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability, and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to become the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly, and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.An astonishingly rich re-creation of the land of Oz, this book retells the story of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, who wasn't so wicked after all. Taking readers past the yellow brick road and into a phantasmagoric world rich with imagination and allegory, Gregory Maguire just might change the reputation of one of the most sinister characters in literature.", "editions": ["english", "spanish", "french"], "genres": ["adult", "adult fiction", "classics", "fantasy", "fantasy (fairy tales)", "fantasy (magic)", "fiction", "paranormal (witches)", "retellings", "science fiction fantasy"], "inventory": [{"status": "available", "stock_id": "24653_1"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "24653_2"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "24653_3"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "24653_4"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "24653_5"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "24653_6"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "24653_7"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "24653_8"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "24653_9"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 579514, "score": 3.54}, "pages": 882, "title": "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37442.Wicked", "year_published": 1995}

The letters are all addressed to \"My dear and unfortunate successor,\" and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of, a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself--to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive. What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe.

{"author": "Ray Bradbury", "id": "4046", "description": "That The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. --Stanley WiaterContents:\u00b7 Prologue: The Illustrated Man \u00b7 ss * \u00b7 The Veldt [\u201cThe World the Children Made\u201d] \u00b7 ss The Saturday Evening Post Sep 23 \u201950 \u00b7 Kaleidoscope \u00b7 ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Oct \u201949 \u00b7 The Other Foot \u00b7 ss New Story Magazine Mar \u201951 \u00b7 The Highway [as by Leonard Spalding] \u00b7 ss Copy Spr \u201950 \u00b7 The Man \u00b7 ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Feb \u201949 \u00b7 The Long Rain [\u201cDeath-by-Rain\u201d] \u00b7 ss Planet Stories Sum \u201950 \u00b7 The Rocket Man \u00b7 ss Maclean\u2019s Mar 1 \u201951 \u00b7 The Fire Balloons [\u201c\u2018In This Sign...\u2019\u201d] \u00b7 ss Imagination Apr \u201951 \u00b7 The Last Night of the World \u00b7 ss Esquire Feb \u201951 \u00b7 The Exiles [\u201cThe Mad Wizards of Mars\u201d] \u00b7 ss Maclean\u2019s Sep 15 \u201949; F&SF Win \u201950 \u00b7 No Particular Night or Morning \u00b7 ss * \u00b7 The Fox and the Forest [\u201cTo the Future\u201d] \u00b7 ss Colliers May 13 \u201950 \u00b7 The Visitor \u00b7 ss Startling Stories Nov \u201948 \u00b7 The Concrete Mixer \u00b7 ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Apr \u201949 \u00b7 Marionettes, Inc.

{"author": "Max Brooks", "id": "25948", "description": "The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \"By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?\"Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.", "editions": ["english"], "genres": ["apocalyptic (post apocalyptic)", "audiobook", "fantasy", "fiction", "horror", "horror (zombies)", "science fiction", "science fiction (apocalyptic)", "science fiction (dystopia)", "war"], "inventory": [{"status": "available", "stock_id": "25948_1"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 452501, "score": 4.01}, "pages": 1310, "title": "World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8908.World_War_Z", "year_published": 2006}

A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?", "editions": ["english"], "genres": ["adult", "adventure", "audiobook", "fantasy", "fantasy (epic fantasy)", "fantasy (high fantasy)", "fantasy (magic)", "fiction", "science fiction fantasy", "young adult"], "inventory": [{"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "29370_1"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "29370_2"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "29370_3"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 423269, "score": 4.44}, "pages": 277, "title": "The Final Empire", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.The_Final_Empire", "year_published": 2006}

In the aftermath, a curious tradition was invented-something to cheer up everyone who was left and bring the shattered worlds together in the spirit of peace, unity, and understanding.Once every cycle, the civilizations gather for the Metagalactic Grand Prix - part gladiatorial contest, part beauty pageant, part concert extravaganza, and part continuation of the wars of the past. Instead of competing in orbital combat, the powerful species that survived face off in a competition of song, dance, or whatever can be physically performed in an intergalactic talent show. The stakes are high for this new game, and everyone is forced to compete.This year, though, humankind has discovered the enormous universe. And while they expected to discover a grand drama of diplomacy, gunships, wormholes, and stoic councils of aliens, they have instead found glitter, lipstick and electric guitars. Mankind will not get to fight for its destiny - they must sing.A one-hit-wonder band of human musicians, dancers and roadies from London - Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes - have been chosen to represent Earth on the greatest stage in the galaxy. And the fate of their species lies in their ability to rock.", "editions": ["english"], "genres": ["adult", "audiobook", "fantasy", "fiction", "humor", "music", "science fiction", "science fiction fantasy", "space", "space (space opera)"], "inventory": [{"status": "available", "stock_id": "2550_1"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "2550_2"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "2550_3"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "2550_4"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "2550_5"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "2550_6"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "2550_7"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 11504, "score": 3.53}, "pages": 911, "title": "Space Opera", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24100285-space-opera", "year_published": 2018}

Scientists are debating just how smart - and how lethal - to make their current robotic prototypes.

Moving humans off the battlefield makes wars easier to start, but more complex to fight. Replacing men with machines may save some lives, but will lower the morale and psychological barriers to killing.

Across America, a mysterious pathogen transforms ordinary people into raging killers, psychopaths driven by a terrifying, alien agenda. The human race fights back, yet after every battle the disease responds, adapts, using sophisticated strategies and brilliant ruses to fool its pursuers. The only possible explanation: the epidemic is driven not by evolution but by some malevolent intelligence.Standing against this unimaginable threat is a small group, assembled under the strictest secrecy. Their best weapon is hulking former football star Perry Dawsey, left psychologically shattered by his own struggles with this terrible enemy, who possesses an unexplainable ability to locate the disease's hosts. Violent and unpredictable, Perry is both the nation's best hope and a terrifying liability. Hardened CIA veteran Dew Phillips must somehow forge a connection with him if they're going to stand a chance against this maddeningly adaptable opponent. Alongside them is Margaret Montoya, a brilliant epidemiologist who fights for a cure even as she reels under the weight of endless horrors. These three and their team have kept humanity in the game, but that's not good enough anymore, not when the disease turns contagious, triggering a fast countdown to Armageddon. Meanwhile, other enemies join the battle, and a new threat -- one that comes from a most unexpected source -- may ultimately prove the most dangerous of all.Catapulting the reader into a world where humanity's life span is measured in hours and the president's finger hovers over the nuclear button, rising star Scott Sigler takes us on a breathtaking, hyper-adrenalized ride filled with terror and jaw-dropping action.

The only condition: she must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London\u2019s Crystal Palace\u2014the world\u2019s fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce.

It'll\u00a0certainly cost him what's left of his innocence. It may\u00a0well\u00a0cost him his life. Interview with the Author Q - What makes the Janus Group series special?A - Growing up, I loved books like Ender's Game and the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan series. When I sat down to write the Janus Group books, I wanted to capture what I liked best about those books - sci fi thrillers or action thrillers in a fast-paced style. The series is best characterized as cyberpunk science fiction thrillers, with a little detective and police procedural elements thrown in to boot. Finally, I like my characters to be relatable, and facing overwhelming odds - the plot is action-packed, and keeps you guessing. Beware: plot twists ahead!Q - What order should I read the books in?\u00a0A - Last Pursuit is a short story set in the Janus Group world - it's the prequel, and the story that inspired me to write a full series. You can read that first (for free), then Books 1-3 (Rath's Deception, Rath's Gambit, and Rath's Reckoning) in order from there. Books 1-3 are a complete story arc - Book 3 resolves everything from Books 1 and 2.Q - Why should readers give these books a try?\u00a0A - Because the Janus Group books are fast, inventive, page-turners that kick ass and take names! They've been described as \"Jason Bourne\" meets \"Bladerunner.\" Any fans of hitman books, science fiction assassin tales, or cyberpunk thrillers will enjoy them.Q - Can readers get the whole series in one bundle?\u00a0A - Not yet - sorry, just haven't had a chance to get around to it!

{"author": "John Joseph Adams", "id": "800", "description": "Famine, Death, War, and Pestilence - the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the harbingers of Armageddon - these are our guides through the Wastelands. From the Book of Revelation to The Road Warrior, from A Canticle for Leibowitz to The Road, storytellers have long imagined the end of the world, weaving eschatological tales of catastrophe, chaos, and calamity. In doing so, these visionary authors have addressed one of the most challenging and enduring themes of imaginative fiction: The nature of life in the aftermath of total societal collapse. Gathering together the best post-apocalyptic literature of the last two decades from many of today's most renowned authors of speculative fiction - including George R. R. Martin, Gene Wolfe, Orson Scott Card, Carol Emshwiller, Jonathan Lethem, Octavia E. Butler, and Stephen King - Wastelands explores the scientific, psychological, and philosophical questions of what it means to remain human in the wake of Armageddon. Whether the end of the world comes through nuclear war, ecological disaster, or cosmological cataclysm, these are tales of survivors, in some cases struggling to rebuild the society that was, in others, merely surviving, scrounging for food in depopulated ruins and defending themselves against monsters, mutants, and marauders. Wastelands delves into this bleak landscape, uncovering the raw human emotion and heart-pounding thrills at the genre's core. --back coverContains the following stories:Introduction by John Joseph AdamsThe End of the Whole Mess by Stephen KingSalvage by Orson Scott CardThe People of Sand and Slag by Paolo BacigalupiBread and Bombs by M.

{"author": "Alan Moore", "id": "1851", "description": "\"I shall tell you where we are. We're in the most extreme and utter region of the human mind. A dim, subconscious underworld. A radiant abyss where men meet themselves. Hell, Netley. We're in Hell.\" Having proved himself peerless in the arena of reinterpreting superheroes, Alan Moore turned his ever-incisive eye to the squalid, enigmatic world of Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders of 1888. Weighing in at 576 pages, From Hell is certainly the most epic of Moore's works and remarkably and is possibly his finest effort yet in a career punctuated by such glorious highlights as Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Going beyond the myriad existing theories, which range from the sublime to the ridiculous, Moore presents an ingenious take on the slaughter. His Ripper's brutal activities are the epicentre of a conspiracy involving the very heart of the British Establishment, including the Freemasons and The Royal Family. A popular claim, which is transformed through Moore's exquisite and thoroughly gripping vision, of the Ripper crimes being the womb from which the 20th century, so enmeshed in the celebrity culture of violence, received its shocking, visceral birth. Bolstered by meticulous research that encompasses a wide spectrum of Ripper studies and myths and coupled with his ability to evoke sympathies in such monstrous characters, Moore has created perhaps the finest examination of the Ripper legacy, observing far beyond society's obsessive need to expose Evil's visage. Ultimately, as Moore observes, Jack's identity and his actions are inconsequential to the manner in which society embraced the Fear: \"It's about us. It's about our minds and how they dance. Jack mirrors our hysterias. Faceless, he is the receptacle for each new social panic.\" Eddie Campbell's stunning black and white artwork, replete with a scratchy, dirty sheen, is perfectly matched to the often-unshakeable intensity of Moore's writing. Between them, each murder is rendered in horrifying detail, providing the book's most unnerving scenes, made more so in uncomfortable, yet lyrical moments as when the villain embraces an eviscerated corpse, craving understanding; pleading that they \"are wed in legend, inextricable within eternity\". Though technically a comic, the term hardly begins to describe From Hell's inimitable grandeur and finesse, as it takes the medium to fresh heights of ingenuity and craftsmanship. Moore and Campbell's autopsy on the emaciated corpse of the Ripper myth has divulged a deeply disturbing yet undeniably captivating masterpiece. \u2014Danny Graydon", "editions": ["english", "spanish"], "genres": ["comics (comic book)", "fiction", "graphic novels comics", "historical", "historical (historical fiction)", "horror", "mystery", "mystery (crime)", "sequential art (comics)", "sequential art (graphic novels)"], "inventory": [{"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1851_1"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1851_2"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "1851_3"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "1851_4"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1851_5"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1851_6"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "1851_7"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1851_8"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1851_9"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 34013, "score": 4.18}, "pages": 700, "title": "From Hell", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23529.From_Hell", "year_published": 1999}

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com", "editions": ["english"], "genres": ["adventure", "audiobook", "classics", "fantasy", "fiction", "science fiction", "science fiction (dystopia)", "science fiction fantasy", "war", "young adult"], "inventory": [{"status": "available", "stock_id": "43765_1"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "43765_2"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 1162542, "score": 4.3}, "pages": 315, "title": "Ender's Game", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game", "year_published": 1985}

We might imagine\u2014and hope\u2014that today's industrial revolution will unfold like the last: even as some jobs are eliminated, more will be created to deal with the new innovations of a new era. In Rise of the Robots, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Martin Ford argues that this is absolutely not the case. As technology continues to accelerate and machines begin taking care of themselves, fewer people will be necessary. Artificial intelligence is already well on its way to making \u201cgood jobs\u201d obsolete: many paralegals, journalists, office workers, and even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by robots and smart software. As progress continues, blue and white collar jobs alike will evaporate, squeezing working- and middle-class families ever further. At the same time, households are under assault from exploding costs, especially from the two major industries\u2014education and health care\u2014that, so far, have not been transformed by information technology. The result could well be massive unemployment and inequality as well as the implosion of the consumer economy itself.In Rise of the Robots, Ford details what machine intelligence and robotics can accomplish, and implores employers, scholars, and policy makers alike to face the implications. The past solutions to technological disruption, especially more training and education, aren't going to work, and we must decide, now, whether the future will see broad-based prosperity or catastrophic levels of inequality and economic insecurity.

Random Acts of Senseless Violence, Womack's fifth novel, is a thrilling, hysterical, and eerily disturbing piece ot work. Lola Hart is an ordinary twelve-year-old girl. She comes from a comfortable family, attends an exclusive private school, loves her friends Lori and Katherine, teases her sister Boob. But in the increasingly troubled city where she lives (a near-future Manhattan) she is a dying breed. Riots, fire, TB outbreaks, roaming gangs, increasing inflation, political and civil unrest all threaten her way of life, as well as the very fabric of New York City. In her diary, Lola chronicles the changes she and her family make as they attempt to adjust to a city, and a country, that is spinning out of control. Her mother is a teacher, but no one is hiring. Her father is a writer, but no one is buying his scripts. Hounded by creditors and forced to vacate their apartment and move to Harlem, her family, and her life, begins to dissolve. Increasingly estranged from her privileged school friends, Lola soon makes new ones: Iz, Jude, and Weezie - wise veterans of the street who know what must be done in order to survive and are more than willing to do it. And the metamorphosis of Lola Hart, who is surrounded by the new language and violence of the streets, begins. Simultaneously chilling and darkly hilarious, Random Acts of Senseless Violence takes the jittery urban fears we suppress, both in fiction and in daily life, and makes them explicit - and explicitly terrifying.--Publisher/Powells.com", "editions": ["english", "spanish", "french"], "genres": ["apocalyptic (post apocalyptic)", "fiction", "new york", "novels", "science fiction", "science fiction (apocalyptic)", "science fiction (cyberpunk)", "science fiction (dystopia)", "science fiction fantasy", "speculative fiction"], "inventory": [{"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "324_1"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "324_2"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "324_3"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "324_4"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "324_5"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "324_6"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "324_7"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 2317, "score": 3.95}, "pages": 1104, "title": "Random Acts of Senseless Violence", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1129928.Random_Acts_of_Senseless_Violence", "year_published": 1993}

Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before THE HOBBIT.Tolkien considered THE SILMARILLION his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing. The story of the creation of the world and of the the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in THE LORD OF THE RINGS look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. THE SILMARILLION is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R.

In 1988 he is forty-seven, living in San Francisco. Suddenly he is - still his modern self - wandering in a city and time he knows mysteriously well: fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna. It is 1897, precisely ninety-one years before his last memory and a half-century before his birth. It's not long before Wheeler has acquired appropriate clothes, money, lodging, a group of young Viennese intellectuals as friends, a mentor in Sigmund Freud, a bitter rival, a powerful crush on a luminous young American woman, a passing acquaintance with local celebrity Mark Twain, and an incredible and surprising insight into the dashing young war-hero father he never knew. But the truth at the center of Wheeler's dislocation in time remains a stubborn mystery that will take months of exploration and a lifetime of memories to unravel and that will, in the end, reveal nothing short of the eccentric Burden family's unrivaled impact on the very course of the coming century.

A theme park attracting 65,000 visitors each day, its dazzling array of robots and futuristic holograms make it a worldwide sensation. But ominous mishaps are beginning to disrupt the once flawless technology. A friendly robot goes haywire, causing panic, and a popular roller coaster malfunctions, nearly killing a teenaged rider. Dr. Andrew Warne, the brilliant computer engineer who designed much of the park\u2019s robotics, is summoned from the East Coast to get things back on track.On the day Warne arrives, however, Utopia is caught in the grip of something far more sinister. A group of ruthless criminals has infiltrated the park\u2019s computerized infrastructure, giving them complete access to all of Utopia\u2019s attractions and systems. Their communication begins with a simple and dire warning: If their demands are met, none of the 65,000 people in the park that day will ever know they were there; if not, chaos will descend, and every man, woman, and child will become a target.

{"author": "John Markoff", "id": "92", "description": "Robots are poised to transform today's society as completely as the Internet did twenty years ago. Pulitzer prize-winning New York Times science writer John Markoff argues that we must decide to design ourselves into our future, or risk being excluded from it altogether.In the past decade, Google introduced us to driverless cars; Apple debuted Siri, a personal assistant that we keep in our pockets; and an Internet of Things connected the smaller tasks of everyday life to the farthest reaches of the Web. Robots have become an integral part of society on the battlefield and the road; in business, education, and health care. Cheap sensors and powerful computers will ensure that in the coming years, these robots will act on their own. This new era offers the promise of immensely powerful machines, but it also reframes a question first raised more than half a century ago, when the intelligent machine was born. Will we control these systems, or will they control us?In Machines of Loving Grace, John Markoff offers a sweeping history of the complicated and evolving relationship between humans and computers. In recent years, the pace of technological change has accelerated dramatically, posing an ethical quandary. If humans delegate decisions to machines, who will be responsible for the consequences? As Markoff chronicles the history of automation, from the birth of the artificial intelligence and intelligence augmentation communities in the 1950s and 1960s, to the modern-day brain trusts at Google and Apple in Silicon Valley, and on to the expanding robotics economy around Boston, he traces the different ways developers have addressed this fundamental problem and urges them to carefully consider the consequences of their work. We are on the brink of the next stage of the computer revolution, Markoff argues, and robots will profoundly transform modern life. Yet it remains for us to determine whether this new world will be a utopia. Moreover, it is now incumbent upon the designers of these robots to draw a bright line between what is human and what is machine.After nearly forty years covering the tech industry, Markoff offers an unmatched perspective on the most drastic technology-driven societal shifts since the introduction of the Internet. Machines of Loving Grace draws on an extensive array of research and interviews to present an eye-opening history of one of the most pressing questions of our time, and urges us to remember that we still have the opportunity to design ourselves into the future\u2014before it's too late.", "editions": ["english"], "genres": ["artificial intelligence", "business", "history", "nonfiction", "philosophy", "psychology", "science", "science (computer science)", "science (technology)", "science fiction (robots)"], "inventory": [{"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "92_1"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 536, "score": 3.68}, "pages": 643, "title": "Machines of Loving Grace: The Quest for Common Ground Between Humans and Robots", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23460922-machines-of-loving-grace", "year_published": 2015}

Yet when she takes Borne to her subterranean sanctuary, the Balcony Cliffs, Rachel convinces her lover, Wick, not to render Borne down to raw genetic material for the drugs he sells\u2014she cannot break that bond.Wick is a special kind of supplier, because the drug dealers in the city don\u2019t sell the usual things. They sell tiny creatures that can be swallowed or stuck in the ear, and that release powerful memories of other people\u2019s happier times or pull out forgotten memories from the user\u2019s own mind\u2014or just produce beautiful visions that provide escape from the barren, craterous landscapes of the city.Against his better judgment, out of affection for Rachel or perhaps some other impulse, Wick respects her decision. Rachel, meanwhile, despite her loyalty to Wick, knows he has kept secrets from her. Searching his apartment, she finds a burnt, unreadable journal titled \u201cMord,\u201d a cryptic reference to the Magician (a rival drug dealer) and evidence that Wick has planned the layout of the Balcony Cliffs to match the blueprint of the Company building. What is he hiding? Why won\u2019t he tell her about what happened when he worked for the Company?", "editions": ["english", "spanish", "french"], "genres": ["adult", "apocalyptic (post apocalyptic)", "audiobook", "fantasy", "fantasy (weird fiction)", "fiction", "science fiction", "science fiction (dystopia)", "science fiction fantasy", "speculative fiction"], "inventory": [{"status": "available", "stock_id": "3339_1"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "3339_2"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "3339_3"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "3339_4"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 26119, "score": 3.93}, "pages": 401, "title": "Borne", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31451186-borne", "year_published": 2017}

To the surprise of both the veteran \"Dogs\" and her fellow \"puppies,\" Beka requests duty in the Lower City. The Lower City is a tough beat. But it's also where Beka was born, and she's comfortable there.Beka gets her wish. She's assigned to work with Mattes and Clary, famed veterans among the Provost's Dogs. They're tough, they're capable, and they're none too happy about the indignity of being saddled with a puppy for the first time in years. What they don't know is that Beka has something unique to offer. Never much of a talker, Beka is a good listener. So good, in fact, that she hears things that Mattes and Clary never could - information that is passed in murmurs when flocks of pigeons gather ... murmurs that are the words of the dead.In this way, Beka learns of someone in the Lower City who has overturned the power structure of the underworld and is terrorizing its citizens into submission and silence. Beka's magical listening talent is the only way for the Provost's Dogs to find out the identity of this brutal new underlord, for the dead are beyond fear. And the ranks of the dead will be growing if the Dogs can't stop a crime wave the likes of which has never been seen. Luckily for the people of the Lower City, the new puppy is a true terrier!", "editions": ["english", "spanish", "french"], "genres": ["adventure", "fantasy", "fantasy (high fantasy)", "fantasy (magic)", "fiction", "mystery", "science fiction fantasy", "young adult", "young adult (teen)", "young adult (young adult fantasy)"], "inventory": [{"status": "available", "stock_id": "1971_1"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1971_2"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "1971_3"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "1971_4"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "1971_5"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "1971_6"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 68295, "score": 4.1}, "pages": 1097, "title": "Terrier", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13829.Terrier", "year_published": 2006}

Gleick tracks the evolution of time travel as an idea in the culture from Marcel Proust to Doctor Who, from Woody Allen to Jorge Luis Borges.

In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future.From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals\u2014and the limits\u2014of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories\u2014Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains:\u00b7 How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers \u201cdownstream\u201d\u00b7 How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars\u00b7 How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology\u00b7 Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build oneKaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.", "editions": ["english", "spanish"], "genres": ["adult", "adventure", "audiobook", "epic", "fantasy", "fantasy (epic fantasy)", "fantasy (high fantasy)", "fantasy (magic)", "fiction", "science fiction fantasy"], "inventory": [{"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "21334_1"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "21334_2"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "21334_3"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "21334_4"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "21334_5"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "21334_6"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 323258, "score": 4.62}, "pages": 421, "title": "The Way of Kings", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings", "year_published": 2010}

{"author": "Kim Zetter", "id": "539", "description": "In January 2010, inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency noticed that centrifuges at a uranium enrichment plant in Iran were failing and being replaced at an unprecedented rate. The cause of their failure was a complete mystery.Five months later, a seemingly unrelated event occurred. A computer security firm in Belarus was called in to troubleshoot some computers in Iran that were caught in a reboot loop\u2014crashing and rebooting repeatedly. At first, technicians with the firm believed the malicious code they found on the machines was a simple, routine piece of malware. But as they and other experts around the world investigated, they discovered a virus of unparalleled complexity and mysterious provenance and intent. They had, they soon learned, stumbled upon the world\u2019s first digital weapon.Stuxnet, as it came to be known, was unlike any other virus or worm built before: It was the first attack that reached beyond the computers it targeted to physically destroy the equipment those computers controlled. It was an ingenious attack, jointly engineered by the United States and Israel, that worked exactly as planned, until the rebooting machines gave it all away. And the discovery of Stuxnet was just the beginning: Once the digital weapon was uncovered and deciphered, it provided clues to other tools lurking in the wild. Soon, security experts found and exposed not one but three highly sophisticated digital spy tools that came from the same labs that created Stuxnet. The discoveries gave the world its first look at the scope and sophistication of nation-state surveillance and warfare in the digital age.Kim Zetter, a senior reporter at Wired, has covered hackers and computer security since 1999 and is one of the top journalists in the world on this beat. She was among the first reporters to cover Stuxnet after its discovery and has authored many of the most comprehensive articles about it. In COUNTDOWN TO ZERO DAY: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World\u2019s First Digital Weapon, Zetter expands on this work to show how the code was designed and unleashed and how its use opened a Pandora\u2019s Box, ushering in an age of digital warfare in which any country\u2019s infrastructure\u2014power grids, nuclear plants, oil pipelines, dams\u2014is vulnerable to the same kind of attack with potentially devastating results.

Despite every World's Fair prediction, every futuristic ride at Disneyland, and the advertisements on the last page of every comic book, we are not living the future we were promised. By now, life was supposed to be a fully automated, atomic-powered, germ-free Utopia, a place where a grown man could wear a velvet spandex unitard and not be laughed at. Where are the ray guns, the flying cars, and the hoverboards that we expected? What happened to our promised moon colonies? Our servant robots? In Where's My Jetpack?, roboticist Daniel H. Wilson takes a hilarious look at the future we always imagined for ourselves. He exposes technology, spotlights existing prototypes, and reveals drawing-board plans. You will learn which technologies are already available, who made them, and where to find them. If the technology is not public, you will learn how to build, buy, or steal it. And if doesn't yet exist, you will learn what stands in the way of making it real. With thirty entries spanning everything from teleportation to self-contained skyscraper cities, and superbly illustrated by Richard Horne (101 Things to Do Before You Die), Where's My Jetpack? is an endlessly entertaining, one-of-a-kind look at the world that we always wanted.

The keys to this empire belong to the powerful North family - composed of successive generations of clones. Yet these clones are not identical. For one thing, genetic errors have crept in with each generation. For another, the original three clone \"brothers\" have gone their separate ways, and the branches of the family are now friendly rivals more than allies. Or maybe not so friendly. At least that's what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst. Sid is a solid investigator who'd like nothing better than to hand off this hot potato of a case. The way he figures it, whether he solves the crime or not, he'll make enough enemies to ruin his career. Yet Sid's case is about to take an unexpected turn: Because the circumstances of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to a killing that took place years ago on the planet St. Libra, where a North clone and his entire household were slaughtered in cold blood.The convicted slayer, Angela Tramelo, has always claimed her innocence. And now it seems she may have been right. Because only the St. Libra killer could have committed the Newcastle crime. Problem is, Angela also claims that the murderer was an alien monster. Now Sid must navigate through a Byzantine minefield of competing interests within the police department and the world's political and economic elite...all the while hunting down a brutal killer poised to strike again. And on St. Libra, Angela, newly released from prison, joins a mission to hunt down the elusive alien, only to learn that the line between hunter and hunted is a thin one.", "editions": ["english", "spanish", "french"], "genres": ["adventure", "audiobook", "fantasy", "fiction", "mystery", "mystery (crime)", "science fiction", "science fiction fantasy", "space (space opera)", "thriller"], "inventory": [{"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "1218_1"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "1218_2"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "1218_3"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1218_4"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1218_5"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "1218_6"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "1218_7"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1218_8"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "1218_9"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 15464, "score": 4.06}, "pages": 1298, "title": "Great North Road", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13573419-great-north-road", "year_published": 2012}

He will continue traveling back to inhabit the body of an Indian child during the battle at Little Bighorn and then ride with an Indian tracker in the nineteenth century before materializing as an airline pilot jetting through the skies today. During these furious travels through time, his refrain grows: \"Who's to judge?\" and \"I don't understand humans.\" When finally, blessedly, our young warrior comes to rest again in his own life, he is mightily transformed by all he has seen.This is Sherman Alexie at his most brilliant--making us laugh while he's breaking our hearts. Time Out has said that \"Alexie, like his characters, is on a modern-day vision quest,\" and in Flight he seeks nothing less than an understanding of why human beings hate. Flight is irrepressible, fearless, and groundbreaking Alexie.", "editions": ["english", "spanish"], "genres": ["audiobook", "contemporary", "fantasy", "fiction", "historical (historical fiction)", "magical realism", "novels", "science fiction", "science fiction (time travel)", "young adult"], "inventory": [{"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "2193_1"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "2193_2"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "2193_3"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "2193_4"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "2193_5"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 15463, "score": 3.89}, "pages": 1171, "title": "Flight", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52872.Flight", "year_published": 2007}

Instead, they are taught to persuade. Here the art of coercion has been raised to a science. Students harness the hidden power of language to manipulate the mind and learn to break down individuals by psychographic markers in order to take control of their thoughts. The very best will graduate as \"poets\", adept wielders of language who belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization's recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless.

{"author": "Sydney Padua", "id": "902", "description": "\nTHE THRILLING ADVENTURES OF LOVELACE AND BABBAGE\n . . . in which Sydney Padua transforms one of the most compelling scientific collaborations into a hilarious series of adventures. Meet Victorian London\u2019s most dynamic duo: Charles Babbage, the unrealized inventor of the computer, and his accomplice, Ada, Countess of Lovelace, the peculiar protoprogrammer and daughter of Lord Byron. When Lovelace translated a description of Babbage\u2019s plans for an enormous mechanical calculating machine in 1842, she added annotations three times longer than the original work. Her footnotes contained the first appearance of the general computing theory, a hundred years before an actual computer was built. Sadly, Lovelace died of cancer a decade after publishing the paper, and Babbage never built any of his machines. But do not despair! The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage presents a rollicking alternate reality in which Lovelace and Babbage do build the Difference Engine and then use it to build runaway economic models, battle the scourge of spelling errors, explore the wilder realms of mathematics, and, of course, fight crime\u2014for the sake of both London and science. Complete with extensive footnotes that rival those penned by Lovelace herself, historical curiosities, and never-before-seen diagrams of Babbage\u2019s mechanical, steam-powered computer, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is wonderfully whimsical, utterly unusual, and, above all, entirely irresistible.(With black-and-white illustrations throughout.)\u00a0", "editions": ["english", "spanish", "french"], "genres": ["biography", "graphic novels comics", "historical", "history", "humor", "nonfiction", "science", "science fiction (steampunk)", "sequential art (comics)", "sequential art (graphic novels)"], "inventory": [{"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "902_1"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "902_2"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "902_3"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "902_4"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "902_5"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "902_6"}, {"status": "maintenance", "stock_id": "902_7"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 4191, "score": 4.03}, "pages": 1100, "title": "The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822839-the-thrilling-adventures-of-lovelace-and-babbage", "year_published": 2015}

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition", "editions": ["english", "spanish"], "genres": ["adult", "audiobook", "classics", "european literature (british literature)", "fantasy", "fiction", "historical", "historical (historical fiction)", "historical (medieval)", "novels"], "inventory": [{"status": "available", "stock_id": "31897_1"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "31897_2"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "31897_3"}, {"status": "on_loan", "stock_id": "31897_4"}, {"status": "available", "stock_id": "31897_5"}], "metrics": {"rating_votes": 664188, "score": 4.32}, "pages": 1026, "title": "The Pillars of the Earth", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth", "year_published": 1989}
